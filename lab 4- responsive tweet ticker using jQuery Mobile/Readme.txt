I used jQuery Mobile and CSS queries to convert lab 1 tweet ticker into a mobile-first responsive design. 

jQuery Mobile's grid attributes was used to stack the two tables vertically when screen width was insufficent to hold both side-by-side.

CSS Media Queries was used to resize the tables and to wrap the text. This was done using several CSS files that got dynamically selected based on the browser width.
